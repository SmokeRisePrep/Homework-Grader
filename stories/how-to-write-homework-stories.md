### Stories are ideas. 

When you're writing a story remember that it will need to be understandable by both the students, the teacher and the developer writing the test.

We use an adoptation of traditional [Agile user stories][1] that stories should be short, from your own perspective, easy to read and understand. Most importantly to learning coding, stories should explain the value of learning a particular concept.

Commonly, user stories follow the format below:

```As a <type of user>, I want <some goal> so that <some reason>.```

A realistic example:

```As a beginner ruby programmer I want to write syntaxtually correct Ruby code so that I can learn how be a good developer.```
