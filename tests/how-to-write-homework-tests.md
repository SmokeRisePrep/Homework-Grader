### Tests shouldn't be hard

Tests should be written to determine if a particular set of stories have been satisfied. Tests are used to prove if a student has correctly coded an element of an assignment. As students progress, their assignments will be exposed to more tests.

### Assigning tests to stories

Test documentation should be correctly associated with a test. Remember that the tests can be run locally by students and by teachers to grade assignments.
